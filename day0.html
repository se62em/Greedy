        <h2>i made this website just to feel like you're with me again 
            <br></br> i talked about you caring about the smallest things i did way too much to a friend of mine 
            <br>i cant just get rid of that feeling of you not being there or rooting for me anymore so i guess that will help me a little even if i dont know if you're seeing this or not </h2>


            <h2>but ig thats a good work around our promise without breaking it (I WARNED YOU TO NOT OPEN MY PROFILE iN THE FIRST CATALOG SO DONT BLAME ME)<br> and i swear on my momma when i asked you to keep my number it wasnt for this i really just wanted to able to glanc at your picutre whenever i can but im getting a lil too greedy and had this idea</h2>
            
            <h2><br> Now off to what happened today : </h2>
            <h2>yesterday i was taking an english test in my new collage (The AOU) so they can decide what level im at and start teaching me from the next level (i'd say i did pretty good because i was just 1 level under the final level) but i came back home very tired because the collage is so for from here ( 70kms :/ ) 
                <br>and public transportaion for 4-6 hours was so ass in this abslout HEAT of a weather
                <br>so when i came back home i slept like a baby even though i wanted to wake up early (5am) to go to the gym but i just couldnt
                <br>, i woke up at like 12 or 1 pm and went to the very first gym i used to go to and they somehow had better machines than gyms i payed literal thousands to
                <br>, the angle of the bench press made me feel like im in heaven again and started ripping the 60's for 7 reps (yes im a lil weaker these days because i couldnt bring myself to do anything the past couple of months)
                <br>when i came back home i started my daily cycle of thinking about what i did wrong , how i can fix anything , and finally came to the realization 
                that i wont be able to actually fix anything if i didnt talk to you first
                <br>so i rushed to Vodafone to make a new SIM card and we both know what happened next
                <br>i realized something while talking to you today , i wasnt planning on giving up the conversation unless im blocked or i made things work out , 
                <br>but mid-way through writing the try number 100 i realized that i was a bit selfish , i realized at that moment that i've always been slefish , 
                <br>this thought made me realize maybe i didnt change that much after all , maybe you're really better off with yourself 
                <br>so i decided to stop trying and actually change something for once , 
                <br>but deep down i know i didnt want it to end that way , i didnt want you to hate me , i didnt want to live in your memory as the worst person you've ever met.
                <br><br> i wanted things to change for once in my life , and i've been wanting that for a while now
                <br>but i think i will be achiving this through not bothering you again.
            </h2>
