        <h1>today was a very long day</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="context">
        <h1>i'd like to say i woke up this day but i didnt , i didnt sleep yet , i cant stop thinking and when i try to sleep i get very bad headaches and its going to drive me insane soon
            <br>
            <br>However , it was partally a good day i'd say , i went to the gym at 5am to wind off
            and it was actually a pretty heat session , i changed my methods a little and it was an absloute animal of a workout
            heavy weight , low reps , i was able to train lat pull downs with semi good form (My ass never touched the seat because the weight was 100kgs)
            
            <br>
            <br>

            But before i went to the gym , when i was getting ready i decided to scroll on ig for a while , and i heared a quote from sam sulik (a well known body builder)
            , he was talking about how he would like to go too far rather than not far enough
            <br><br>
            and my 2 brain cells actually started thinking , i've always said i've done that , but i just now realized that i didnt do it for the only person who was ready to go all the way with me
            , i actually never lived up to my word
            <br><br>
            and here's the thing , many people on the social media give the idea that they're working hard on themselves to prove that their ex was wrong
            or that she missed out on how bbbbbbbig of a bumass he's going to be.
            <br>
            and unfourtnatly that was a big part of my life , i only wanted to make myself better to prove people that they were wrong about me
            <br> not being able to understand that many of these people wanted the best for me , they never wanted something bad for me , or at least didnt care that much to bring me down
            <br><br>
            and if god forbid i actually understood that they wanted the best for me , i would frame them, completely forgetting what i want , what i need and what i dont need ,

            <br><br> i forgot to think for myself ,and forgot myself in the process , 
            <br><br> and thats exactly why i decided to keep doing the same thing , but in a different way , from now on , i vow to work the hardest to be the only man you can deserve , even if took years or even decades.

            <br> and i'd say it will benefit me too , i will finally find that long lost sould who forgot who it's owner is , ashamed to be related to him in any way.


            <br><br><br>

            HOWEVER
            <br><br>
            i bought a laptop today :3 it got used the fuck out of and was sold for only 1.5k , and will need some real repairing , which i will happily do :3
            , after buying the laptop , i went to visit my uncle in the hospital with the whole family because he broke his hip in the street and had to go through surgery

            <br><br>
            But the second i stepped my foot in the room , i find my mother throwing absloute HANDS with my unc's daughter , and saw his daughter ABOUT to throw hands on my mother , i slimed her and her brother and my mother slimed her mother
            <br><br>
            i felt really sorry for my uncle but it had to go that way because of his daughter making fun of my mother (or so i was told)

            <br><br>
            im repairing the laptop as im writing this and the code for this website but i feel like venting a little more about something , so here it is :
