            before we got back together , when you slimed the fuck out of Katie (im very thankful for that)
            <br><br>
            i actually met my father for the first time in a very long time , i swore to either embarce him or actually throw hands at him myself
            <br>but it didnt go really as planned , i decided to talk first , knowing that he could lie at any moment , but i do know when someone is lying or doing something suspecious
            <br><br>
            when i confronted him about why he used to abuse my mother , i was expecting a "oh im very sorry" or a "that never happened" ,
            but he , with a dead serious face said 'yes i did do that' , i was just as confused as an ant getting pissed on by a human so he continued : "because she cheated on me first"
            <br>that was the final straw for me , i was just about to throw hands at that exact moment , but he then followed it by (i know you think im lying , but if you're going to belive her by only the word of her mouth , why not do the same with me ?)
            i actually didnt know how to respond to that , so i asked him , "Why would she go through 5 years in court just to take me back to EG then ?"
            and he replied with the same dead serious face "why would i go through 5 years in court too just to keep you and not let her take you ? and i know that you know that the judge was my friend so the Child support wasn't going to be an issue for me anyway (he was supposed to pay 100egp for child support every month)"

            <br><br> and i didnt know how to respond for the second time , so i just bitched my tone down and kept talking to him about what i did in the last 12 years or so,

            <br><br> fast forward , couple of months later after we broke up for the final time and i was going to the AOU to ask about them
            <br>i was in the Usual PT when i started thinking about what actually shaped me to be "me" , i was a perfectly normal religious kid , when or where the FUCK did i learn about dirty talking and porn ?
            <br><br>thats when i remembered , i had 8 years old at that time , my mother was stressing about me going back to Saudie arabia and leaving her after all what she did\
            <br><br>so she enrolled me in a private arabic sessions with a guy from tanta , to this day i never knew how or where did she find him
            <br><br>but what i soon realized at that age that these private sessions i was taking were just for the soul reason of my mother to talk to the teacher
            there were 18+ , dirty talking between both of them in these chats , how did i know ? i didnt have a phone for a while as a kid
            <br>so i used to use my mother's phone when she sleeps , sneak some games into her phone at night and delete them at day,
            <br><br>one day when i was downloading games on my mother's phone , i saw a message from messenger , it was my arabic teacher , talking about how he wants to kiss my mother ,
            <br><br>and as a kid i didnt actually understand that it was a bad thing , i even got into the chat and saw the full conversation with my littly bean rising and i didnt understand at that time ,
            <br><br> but what i did understand was a bad thing was her trying to kill me , when i knew she told the daughter of my auntie , i told her that she exposed us and exposed what she did
            <br><br>i never understood why i said that , as i said before , i didnt know that that was a bad thing , but she really felt attacked from what i said
            <br>throwing a knife at me and ripping my skin with her nails and teeth 
            <br>and when the knife didnt actually kill me or cause any harm , she took it back from the floor , and put it's tip in my arm , causing a bruise that you never asked about for some reason , even though its very visible.
            <br><br>when i though about these 3 events what my father said , what my mother did to talk to that man , what she did to me when i told her that she wasn't supposed to tell anyone 
            <br>i realized that maybe she was framing him all along , maybe the person i swore to hate for the rest of my life was actually a decent person after actually
            <br><br>and i realized very late that i actually didnt turn up to be like my father , i turned up to be like the image my mother painted of my father.
