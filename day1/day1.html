    <h1>Day 1 | 8/24/2025</h1>
    <h1>i didnt sleep since yesterday , i just couldnt bring myself to sleep after all what happened.
        <br>even though it was a very hot and tiring day , i had to go to the AOU again today to schedule my subjects
        <br> going there in public transportaion was actually nice since my earphones were charged and i memorized the streets there
        <br>and i had almost 2 hours in the publice transportaion (PT) to think so you know i goddamn did think ,
        <br>
        <br>i thought , what if love was never meant to be permenant ? what if it was like every other feeling comes and goes and then comes again for no reason
        <br> and then i remembered the history of marriage , marriage in history at first was never between 2 loving each other it was based around strengthening the bonds between 2 tribes
        <br> but how could they keep up the marriage based on personal benefits alone ?
        <br>that was when love comes into play , even if they didnt marry each other based on love , love made the 2 love each other temporarly ,
        <br>until the bond between the 2 strenghened , but what kept the marriage up to this point when the presence of love wasn't there ?
        <br>they just endured , call it for the tribe's sake , society's sake , call it what you want , but a lot of marriages was built just based on that , some faild , some worked
        <br>for nothing is promised to work in every human's case. but the beauty is in the try itself of you're capable of trying
        <br>
        <br>
        <br> love without the desire to keep enduring unfourtnatly will never work. and that's what i failed to realize.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>However , when i finished everything and was in PT going back home , a kid , 70kms away from el haram , asked me how to get to السجل المدني , ts ong made my brain turn off for a sec
        , but i told him to come with me , when we reached el remaya , told him to take a bus from there to السجل المدني , and i walked , at 1:30 pm's sun
        , from el remaya to el maryotia , just for the chance that you might be there , and dont get me wrong , i wouldn't bother you or even give you a chance to know that im in a 1kms radius from you , but it would've been nice to see you again from afar.
